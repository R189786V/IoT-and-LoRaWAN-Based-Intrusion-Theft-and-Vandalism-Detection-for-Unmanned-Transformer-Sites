## 1. Introduction

The objective of this project is to develop an IoT-based vehicle tracking system capable of collecting, transmitting, storing, and visualizing GPS location data in real time. The system monitors geographic coordinates, altitude, speed, heading, and device status, allowing users to track vehicle movements and review historical routes through a web dashboard.

## 3. ESP32 Application Architecture

The embedded application follows an event-driven architecture using the ESP-IDF Event Loop.

### Application Components

```

### Component Responsibilities

#### GPS Module

Responsible for communication with the SAM-M10Q GPS receiver and generation of location events.

#### System API

Handles MQTT communication, system synchronization, and internal time management.

#### Wi-Fi Manager

Responsible for network connectivity and reconnection procedures.

#### OLED Display

Displays operational information and diagnostics.

#### Command Interface

Receives commands through the serial interface, such as Wi-Fi credential updates.

---

## 4. Security

Communication between devices and the MQTT broker uses MQTTS (MQTT over TLS). Certificate validation is performed using the ESP-IDF built-in certificate bundle. MQTT authentication requires valid user credentials.

Node-RED also connects securely to the broker using TLS authentication.

InfluxDB operates locally and is not exposed to external networks, reducing the attack surface of the system.
